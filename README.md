# Sorting_Visualizer
Sorting Algorithm Visualiser

Created on 25th April 2020
Developed by Shubhankar-wdsn

This Visualiser is to be used with the sorting algorithms provided in sorting_algorithms.py.
There are 7 algorithms provided namely : selection sort, bubble sort, insertion sort, radix sort,
merge sort, quick sort and heap sort. One note for the visualisation of merge sort is that because of
the splitting and combining of arrays, it was difficult to fully visualise the whole process.Instead
the current arrays being merged are shown.
Usage - After typing the name of this script, you just need to enter the name of the sorting algorithm
you want to use in CamelCase with no spaces.
Note- This visualiser is only for understanding how sorting algorithms work and should not be used to
compare time complexities of various algorithms as most of the time spent by the program is drawing
the array in the screen and not on sorting.
